# Nyloer

This plugin provides two main features:
- Custom color symbols on nylocas based on type (melee / range / mage).
- Displays the wave number when nylocas are spawned.

## Third Party Client Compliance
This plugin is a modified version of the original bonylo plugin. Adjustments were made to ensure compliance with [Jagex's third-party client terms of service](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-guidelines?oldschool=1).

The following features have been removed from the original plugin:

- Nylocas tick counter
- Highlighting based on nylocas age
- Indicator for nylocas that switch to a different type on tick 27
- Explosion warning

The Nylocas tick counter has been replaced with an optional static symbol or static wave number that remains the same throughout the nylocas' lifecycle.

This feature does not indicate `Indicates the time where a boss mechanic may start or end`.
